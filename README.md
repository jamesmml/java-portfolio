# Java Projects

## Description
These projects were developed as part of an introductory CS course to practice applying algorithmic thinking in Java. 
While the logic is foundational, the goal was to build fluency in OOP and syntax distinct from Python.

## Contents
All files are located in the [COMPSCI200](COMPSCI200/) directory.
- [ComplementaryStrands.java](COMPSCI200/ComplementaryStrands.java) - refactoring required: string methods -> eliminate some looping,  validation logic -> consolidate into methods
- [FibonacciRecursion.java](COMPSCI200/FibonacciRecursion.java)
- [FibonacciWithLooping.java](COMPSCI200/FibonacciWithLooping.java)
- [Lottery.java](COMPSCI200/Lottery.java)
- [NumberOrdering.java](COMPSCI200/NumberOrdering.java)
- [TaxRates.java](COMPSCI200/TaxRates.java)
